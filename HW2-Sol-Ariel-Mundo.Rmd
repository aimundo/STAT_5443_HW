#### PROBLEM 1

Since $p(x)=\sin(x)$ the $CDF$ is calculated as:

\[\int_0^{x} \sin w~dw\] which yields:
\[F(x)=1-\cos(x)\] 
and using the inverse CDF Transform:

\[u=1-\cos(F^{-1}(u))\] 
\[F^{-1}(u)=\arccos(1-u)\]


```{r PROBLEM 1}

set.seed(123)
u<-runif(n=10000)
x<-acos(1-u)
y<-seq(0,pi/2,0.1)
f<-1-cos(y)
hist(x,freq = F)
lines(y,f,col="red")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
